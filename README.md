This website is a forum where people can talk, ask questions, and tell stories about their dogs.  In this program, there is the home page which displays all the most recent posts by the users.  At the top of the home page, there is a header with 3 buttons to the home page again, the user profile, and log out button, and a search bar to look for filtered posts.  At the bottom of the home page, there are 3 buttons.  One is to create a post, to go to the site map, and the last is to go back to the top of the page.

The site map contains all the links of the website and is used as a shortcut to go to other pages.

Each post contains the username, title of the post, and the story which people can upvote, downvote, and comment on.  

When the user profile is clicked on, the avatar, short description, number of posts and comments, and recent activity is displayed.
